<p><strong>CCA Name:<br /></strong>Floorball Boys&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br /></strong>'<em>A Team above All, above All a Team</em>'. In the Floorball Boys CCA, we believe in the importance of teamwork, self-reflection and building a strong camaraderie between the players to ensure that we strive together as one to achieve our goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The East Spring Floorball Boys CCA is made up of resilient, disciplined and respectful individuals with a passion for excellence in the sport. Anchored with sportsmanship and school values, players train 2-3 times a week to hone their technical skills and build physical strength.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are taught and developed to grow as leaders as they are empowered to provide inputs into how to improve CCA sessions and they are also guided to plan, execute and review activities such as bonding sessions and VIA projects.</p>
<p><strong>Our Achievements:<br /></strong>2019 'B' Div National Floorball Championships (4th)<br />2018 'C' Div National Floorball Championships (2nd)</p>

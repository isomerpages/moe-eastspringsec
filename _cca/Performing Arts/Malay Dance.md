<p><strong>CCA Name:<br /></strong>Malay Dance</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br /></strong>East Spring Malay Dance believes in every student&rsquo;s potential and aims to develop talent and build self-confidence in our students. We strive to nurture every student and provide opportunities for them to showcase their talent and develop their leadership skills. Our students also learn the importance of teamwork, resilience and commitment as well as always giving their best. We go by the motto &lsquo;With Confidence, We Can Achieve&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Apart from the usual school performances, we also provide the opportunity for our students to participate in many external events, including Muara Festival, a yearly dance event held at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre. For example, our students have had the opportunity to perform at a MHA Appreciation Lunch at Marina Mandarin, with President Halimah Yacob as the Guest-of-Honour. In 2019, we had the honour of being invited by Mediacorp, where our students performed for a local television series, &lsquo;Zaman Persekolahan&rsquo;, which was featured on Suria Channel.</p>
<p>For our student-initiated VIA Projects, our students have embarked on projects such as teaching Malay Dance to primary school students and planned activities for Thong Teck Home and Jamiyah Home for the Aged; where the students did craft activities and performed for the residents. In addition, through our collaboration with the Malay Language unit, the students also had the opportunity to participate in an Overseas Learning Journey to Kuala Lumpur where they performed at a local school there and attended a dance workshop at the renowned Academy of the Arts in Kuala Lumpur, ASWARA.</p>

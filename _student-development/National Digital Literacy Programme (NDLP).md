<h4>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</h4>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD) by end-2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national
e-learning platform – the <a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)</a> –
as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’
learning. This will also better enable students to acquire digital literacy
and technological skills to ensure that students are well-equipped with
the digital competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated
future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of
Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Digital Literacy Framework:</p>

<h4>Use of Edusave</h4>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully
or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous
fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. MOE has provided
Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in 2023 to all eligible
Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of
the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary school students and
$230 for primary school students.</p>
<p>Parents may refer to the FAQ segment for more information on Edusave and
finance matters.</p>
<h4>Financial Assistance</h4>
<p>For students on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, subsidies are available
even if there is an insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket
will be $0. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE
Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining
sums due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the table below for information on the eligibility for the
subsidy:</p>

<h4>Device Management Application (DMA)</h4>
<p><strong>Device Management Application (“DMA”).</strong> &nbsp;A <strong>DMA</strong> will
be pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school and will be installed
on devices that parents/guardians have opted for the student to use in
lieu of the PLD purchased through the school, after parents/guardians have
given consent. The DMA has 3 main components which will support the effective
use of the PLD in the classroom to enhance students' learning and safeguard
their cyber wellness:</p>

<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p>** Personal Learning Device Procurement and Usage**</p>
<p>1. How do we purchase the device through the school?
<br>For parents of the 2025 Secondary 1 cohort, an intend of purchase will
be sent via Parent Gateway (PG) by 3 Jan 2025.</p>
<p>If you are not able to access PG, please contact the school for a hardcopy
version.</p>
<p>2. Can my child not purchase the personal learning device (PLD)? Can we
use our own device?
<br>Every student is required to have a PLD for teaching and learning purposes
and is strongly encouraged to purchase one through the school via MOE’s
bulk tender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all to use the model prescribed by the school for uniformity
and to ensure a smooth learning experience. The device purchased through
the school will come with the necessary warranty and insurance. If students
wish to use their own devices, the school will ascertain whether the students’
devices run on the same OS and have similar technical specifications that
allow the Device Management Application (DMA) to be installed.</p>
<p>For questions regarding the procurement of PLDs, please approach the school’s
HOD and SH ICT for assistance via email to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mr Leung Wai Wang, <a href="mailto:leung_wai_wang@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">leung_wai_wang@moe.edu.sg</a> (HOD

</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Daryl Tan, <a href="mailto:tan_boon_kai_daryl@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">tan_boon_kai_daryl@moe.edu.sg</a> (SH
ICT)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>State the subject (e.g ‘Use of Own Device for PDLP’)&nbsp; and the following
information:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name and Class of child/ward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact number of parent/guardian</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reason/s for wanting to use your own device</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Can students share one PLD with their siblings?
<br>For a smooth learning experience, each student should have his/her own
device as prescribed by the school. This is because different schools may
tap on different devices for teaching and learning. In addition, as students
will be required to use the devices in school daily and for their learning
after school, it might not be practical to share the device with their
siblings.</p>
<p>4. Is the price of the PLD similar or lower than market prices?
<br>The devices in the MOE Device Bulk Tender are price-competitive. The enhanced
device bundle parents/guardians purchase through the school includes a
3-year insurance and a 3-year warranty, which allows for two repairs or
one replacement. This would not be included in the retail price of similar
models sold in the retail market.</p>
<p><strong>Care and Maintenance of Device&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>1. What is the expected shelf life of the Chromebooks? What happens after
the student graduates?
<br>The devices have an average shelf life of 3-4 years, which sufficiently
covers the time a student is in secondary school. The school will uninstall
the DMA from the devices upon students’ graduation, and graduated students
will have full control over their devices.</p>
<p>2. Will students be allowed to store the devices in school overnight?
Where will students store their devices when they go for recess, PE or
CCA?</p>
<p>The school has installed lockers for students to store their devices.
Students are expected to secure their PLDs in the lockers when they are
away from their classrooms. Students should bring home the PLDs at the
end of the school day so that they can utilise the PLDs for learning at
home and ensure that it is fully charged for use the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and Insurance&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>1. What is covered by the insurance? Does it cover accessories?
<br>The PLD will come with a 3-year warranty and insurance coverage allowing
for two repairs or one replacement. The insurance coverage is only applicable
to situations of damages and loss where the student has taken all necessary
precautions to safeguard the PLD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insurance coverage is for the main device only and does not cover accessories.</p>
<p>2. Does a police report/school report need to be made if a student loses
his/her PLD due to negligence?</p>
<p>a. Make a police report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Inform the school to assist with the loan of a temporary device and
assist in purchasing a replacement device.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Please include in the email your proof of purchase, school, device model,
serial number, description of the fault and contact number.</p>
<p>4. What happens if students damage their PLD accidentally?
<br>If the device was damaged accidentally, the parent/guardian can report
it to the school. The school will coordinate with the vendor on the assessment
of damage and repairs. If there are additional costs, the vendor will contact
the parent/guardian before proceeding with the repair. All additional costs
for repairs will be borne by the parent/guardian if not covered by insurance.
Edusave funds cannot be used to pay for the cost of repairs.</p>
<p>If the device is damaged beyond economical repair and is not covered by
insurance, the replacement device will have to be paid for by the parent/guardian.
MOE will provide subsidies to limit the out-of-pocket expense for students
from lower-income families who need to replace their devices not covered
by insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Edusave, Financial Subsidies and Payment</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Can students use their Edusave Fund to purchase PLDs from vendors not
engaged by the school?
<br>The Edusave fund can only be used for purchases facilitated by the school
through MOE’s bulk tender.</p>
<p>2. How do we check the amount of Edusave funds available in our child’s/ward’s
(for Singapore Citizens) account?
<br>You can call 6260 0777 (24-hour automated hotline) to check your child's/ward's
Edusave balance.</p>
<p>3. Can Edusave be used to pay for the purchase of accessories/peripherals
for the PLD?
<br>Edusave can only be purchased for accessories/peripherals that are bundled
with the initial PLD. Edusave cannot be used for an individual's purchase
of optional accessories/peripherals from the vendor.</p>
<p>4. For students whose parents do not want schools to deduct their Edusave
for the purchase of PLDs, can they pay cash instead?
<br>All MOE FAS students must use their Edusave to purchase the PLDs.</p>
<p>School-Based FAS students are strongly encouraged to sign up for the PDLP
Standing Order to minimize the cash outlay.</p>
<p>For Singapore Citizen students who are not under MOE FAS or School Based
FAS, parents may choose not to use the Edusave and pay the amount through
SAM kiosk/app/cash upon receiving the school bill. Parents opting to pay
cash and are onboard GIRO should ensure sufficient amounts in their bank
account.</p>
<p>5. How will students without internet access at home be supported?</p>
<p>Students from eligible low-income households may apply for the DigitalAccess@Home
scheme by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which provides
subsidised broadband access. More information can be found at: &lt;<a href="https://imda.gov.sg/dah" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://imda.gov.sg/dah</a>&amp;gt;.</p>
<p><strong>General Information on DMA</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Is the DMA installation compulsory for all students?</p>
<p>Student devices – including devices that were not procured under the MOE
Device Bulk Tender – on the PLD Initiative are to be installed with DMA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents/guardians who wish to use existing devices as PLDs will also have
sort approval from the school and consent to the installation of DMA, which
will be done without charge. These devices will have to be on the same
OS, and have similar technical specifications, as the school’s PLD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school will also uninstall the DMA from the students’ devices upon
graduation.</p>
<p>2. Why is there a need for DMAs in PLDs?</p>
<p>DMA allows teachers to have appropriate controls in place to manage students’
device usage in classrooms. In addition, the DMA addresses parents’/guardians’
concerns regarding access to undesirable content online (e.g. pornography,
gambling etc) and excessive screen time arising from PLD usage.</p>
<p>3. Would the benefits of installing DMA in the PLDs be overridden given
that students still have unlimited access to their mobile phones and/or
other existing devices?</p>
<p>The DMA restrictions create a safe and conducive digital learning environment,
with fewer distractions such as social media and games, that might detract
students from learning. This is distinct from students’ other personal
devices, including mobile phones, which are more typically used for recreational
purposes.</p>
<p>Parents can consider setting routines on when students should be using
their devices at home, apply for parental control services directly via
their mobile broadband service provider and/or adjust the parental control
setting within their child’s mobile phone to limit screen time if deemed
necessary.**</p>

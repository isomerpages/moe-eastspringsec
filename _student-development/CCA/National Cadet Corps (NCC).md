<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>National Cadet Corps (NCC)</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>A National Uniformed Group, the NCC Land
unit has been a pillar of strength and the epitome of discipline for the
Uniformed Groups in East Spring Secondary School. The passion of the cadets
and the dedication of the officers contributed to the excellent performance
of the Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). The syllabus that the cadets go through
includes Foot Drills, Individual Fieldcraft, Orienteering, Air Rifle Shooting
and SAR21 Shooting Programme. Cadets also attend annual camp in school
as well as adventure camps conducted by HQ NCC. In addition, our cadets
are trained in Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and performed at various events
such as the school’s Open House and National Day Celebrations. With many
opportunities provided to the students for leadership training and character
development, the cadets are groomed to be strong leaders with resilience,
enabling them to also be ready for their National Service.</p>

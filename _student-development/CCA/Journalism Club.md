<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Journalism Club</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>Pictures are indeed worth a thousand words,
and the right photo goes a long way in generating specific emotions in
viewers. Photojournalists in East Spring's Journalism Club learn to capture
the moment in an image to tell a story and capture them in print. In Journalism
Club, students are equipped with practical, transferable skills such as
photography, critical thinking, and the ability to write and report on
key events in school.</p>
<p>Every year, East Spring's Journalism Club participates in the latest national
youth photography competitions available. Some notable competitions participated
in previously include the National Youth Photographer's Award, Temasek
Polytechnic's Green Building and Sustainability Photography competition,
and the national Our School Our Stories competition.</p>
<p>In Journalism Club, students with talents in leadership, welfare, logistics,
photography and writing are groomed early and then selected in Secondary
Three to be part of our Executive Committee to lead the club. Whatever
your talent, there is an opportunity for you!</p>

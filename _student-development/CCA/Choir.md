<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Choir</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The East Spring Chorale is a 60-member strong choir which devotes its time to making good music, going by our motto “We Sing As One!” Indeed, we strive not just for the sound, but for unity and harmony as one big family. All members will learn to sing with proper vocal techniques and learn basics of music theory. We will focus on a variety of choral repertoire which includes classical, folk and songs in foreign languages. Other than singing and preparing for performances, we make it a point to inject fun into practices through team-bonding games. A choir that sings and plays together, stays together!</p>
<p>The Choir aims to provide a platform for students who have passion for music to perform with confidence and to develop their leadership potential. Students will be given the opportunity to grow as leaders as they are guided to plan, execute and review Choir activities like bonding sessions, VIA projects and the like.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The East Spring Chorale is a 50-member choir committed to upholding musical
excellence and ensemble unity, guided by our motto, <em>“We Sing As One.”</em> The
Chorale places strong emphasis not only on achieving a refined choral sound,
but also on fostering a culture of respect, teamwork and camaraderie among
our members.</p>
<p>The Choir members receive systematic training in proper vocal technique
and fundamental music theory, and participate in rehearsals that develop
musical sensitivity, discipline and confidence. The Choir performs a diverse
repertoire, including classical and folk works as well as pieces in various
languages, to broaden students’ musical appreciation and technical proficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As part of their holistic learning experience, members perform at
key school events such as the Lunar New Year Celebration, National Day
Concert and Teachers’ Day Concert, in addition to other school-based and
public showcase opportunities. The Choir also participates in exchange
programmes with other secondary school choirs, where students learn through
shared performances, collaborative rehearsals and peer interactions. These
platforms provide authentic and enriching learning experiences, enabling
students to refine their stage presence, gain exposure to different choir
cultures and build confidence as young musicians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Choir also serves as a leadership-development platform. Students
are encouraged and guided to take on organisational and student-leadership
roles, including the planning and execution of choir activities such as
bonding sessions and VIA initiatives. Through these experiences, members
cultivate responsibility, resilience, collaboration and reflective thinking
— competencies that prepare them to lead and contribute meaningfully to
the school and wider community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At East Spring Chorale, we believe that every voice contributes
to a greater whole, and we are committed to nurturing students who strive
for excellence, serve with integrity, and grow as confident and gracious
performers.</p>

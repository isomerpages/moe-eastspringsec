<p><strong>CCA Name: <br></strong>Badminton</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>Our vision is to inculcate in students not
just proper badminton skills and techniques but essential values like resilience,
responsibility, and synergy through rigorous training and participation
in tournaments. We aim to develop disciplined and resilient athletes who
are able to forge strong bonds amongst teammates and become good team players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rigorous weekly training sessions and practice matches help to deepen
students’ passion for the sport and improve their skills so as to better
prepare them for competitions. Much emphasis is placed on developing our
student athletes in the areas of discipline, mental strength, skills, physical
fitness, leadership and teamwork. Each player is taught to develop their
potential and is encouraged and guided to stretch themselves beyond their
comfort zone to be the best that they can be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Badminton has been actively participating in many competitions, such as
the National School Games Badminton Championships. These competitions not
only allow our players to put what they have learnt into practice, but
also provide them an opportunity to learn from opponents, allowing improvements
in skills and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Our Achievements:<br></strong>2025 Participated in National School
Games (Boys/Girls - ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions)
<br>2024 Participated in National School Games (Boys/Girls - ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions)</p>

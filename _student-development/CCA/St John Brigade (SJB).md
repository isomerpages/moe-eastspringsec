<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>St John Brigade (SJB)</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The St. John Brigade (SJB) is the uniformed
youth arm of St. John Singapore, an organisation dedicated to providing
First Aid, ambulance, and community care services. At East Spring Secondary
School, the SJB embodies the school’s motto through its values, Rising
with First Aid, Innovating through Foot Drill, and Striving for Excellence
in the Brigade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The East Spring SJB Corps consists of two units: the Nursing Unit for
female cadets and the Ambulance Unit for male cadets. The Corps trains
and equips cadets with essential skills in First Aid, Home Nursing, Transportation
of Casualties, Foot Drills, Camp Craft, and Leadership Development. Through
weekly training sessions, cadets cultivate independence, discipline, resilience,
and responsibility, the qualities that prepare them to face future challenges
with confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, SJB introduced the IGNITE Programme, a collaboration between
St. John Singapore and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC). For two consecutive
years, our Secondary 3 cadets have organised community engagement projects
at All Saints’ Home Tampines, spending three afternoons interacting with
elderly residents. This meaningful initiative allows cadets to learn about
ageing, dementia, and eldercare in Singapore, while also contributing actively
to promoting independent and healthy living among seniors. Upon completing
the project, each cadet is awarded the IGNITE Badge, recognising their
service and learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lower secondary cadets also participate annually in the Basic and Advanced
Non-Commissioned Officers’ Courses (BNCO and ANCO). These courses combine
theoretical and experiential learning through camps, empowering cadets
to discover their leadership potential, strengthen teamwork, and build
lifelong values that shape them into confident and compassionate leaders.</p>

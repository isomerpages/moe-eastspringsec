<p><strong>CCA Name: <br></strong>Basketball</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The mission of ESBB is to groom every player
to be ‘<em>A respectable and resilient sportsman who values discipline and teamwork and plays with heart and passion</em>’.</p>
<p>We firmly believe in training hard to achieve the best we can. We strive
to build a strong spirit and a culture of camaraderie and hard work in
our CCA. With the support of our coach, the boys are taught basketball
skills like passing, dribbling and shooting as well as basketball strategies
like attack, defence and set plays.</p>
<p>Together with a team of dedicated teachers who firmly believe in sharing
their love, passion and dedication for the game, the CCA hopes to develop
the boys into respectable sportsmen who value discipline, compete with
tenacity and are excellent team players. We want to share and inculcate
in the boys pride in the game by respecting themselves, the game, and others.</p>
<p>On top of that, we provide leadership opportunities for the boys to learn
to take the lead in the CCA through serving in the executive committee
and planning events such as training camps, Values-in-Action activities
and our in-house Basketball Carnival to bid farewell to our graduating
seniors. With the boys exemplifying resilience, integrity, endurance and
a spirit of sportsmanship, we guide and facilitate their learning to apply
it in every area of their life as a student.</p>

<p><strong>CCA Name: <br></strong>Basketball</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The mission of ESBB is to groom every player to be ‘<em>A respectable and resilient sportsman who values discipline and teamwork and plays with heart and passion</em>’.</p>
<p>We firmly believe in training hard to achieve the best we can. We strive to build a strong spirit and a culture of camaraderie and hard work in our CCA. With the support of our coach, the boys are taught basketball skills like passing, dribbling and shooting as well as basketball strategies like attack, defence and set plays.</p>
<p>Together with a team of dedicated teachers who firmly believe in sharing their love, passion and dedication for the game, the CCA hopes to develop the boys into respectable sportsmen who value discipline, compete with tenacity and are excellent team players. We want to share and inculcate in the boys pride in the game by respecting themselves, the game, and others.</p>
<p>On top of that, we provide leadership opportunities for the boys to learn to take the lead in the CCA through serving in the executive committee and planning events such as training camps, Values-in-Action activities and our in-house Basketball Carnival to bid farewell to our graduating seniors. With the boys exemplifying resilience, integrity, endurance and a spirit of sportsmanship, we guide and facilitate their learning to apply it in every area of their life as a student.</p>
<p><strong>Our Achievements:<br></strong>2020 – Participated in National Schools Games – ‘B’ Division (undefeated in East Zone Competition before suspension due to Covid19)</p>
<p>2019 – Participated in National Schools Games – ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions&nbsp;<br>–&nbsp;ActiveSG Developmental League</p>

<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Floorball</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The East Spring Floorball team strives to
nurture sportsmanship, teamwork, and leadership among its players. Through
rigorous training sessions twice a week, students sharpen their stick-handling
techniques, game strategies, and on-court awareness while building stamina
and endurance. Beyond skill development, the CCA fosters camaraderie and
resilience as students learn to support one another both on and off the
court.</p>
<p>Our players regularly participate in friendly matches and represent the
school in the National School Games (NSG), gaining valuable competitive
experience. The CCA also serves as a springboard for passionate players
to pursue their sporting aspirations, including Direct School Admission
(DSA) opportunities, as they grow into confident and disciplined players.</p>

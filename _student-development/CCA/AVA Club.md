<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>AVA Club</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>AVA Club takes care of all matters relating to the provision of audio and visual support in East Spring Secondary School. Our day-to-day operations include maintaining the sound system for the daily flag-raising and assembly.</p>
<p>In addition, we also ensure the smooth running of school events in the school hall such as Racial Harmony Day and National Day. Beyond school-wide support, AVA club also supports other CCAs and school committees through providing updated and functioning AVA equipment for their various programmes.</p>
<p>All AVA students are also trained in Robotics Programming during the weekly CCA training sessions. Selected students will participate in the annual World Robotics Competition (WRC) organised by the Singapore Science Centre.</p>
<p>Through the execution of these duties, AVA students learn a myriad of skills related to the audio and visual field which can be applicable in not just their daily lives but possibly in their future careers. Moreover, they embody and demonstrate the school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Synergy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our CCA:</strong>
</p>
<p>The AVA Club provides audio and visual support in East Spring Secondary
School. Our day-to-day operations include maintaining the sound system
for daily flag-raising and assembly programmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The AVA Club also ensures the smooth running of school events held in
the school hall, such as Secondary 1 Campfire, Secondary 4 Graduation,
festive celebrations, and Parent-Teacher Conferences. Beyond school-wide
support, the AVA Club supports other CCAs and school committees by providing
AVA equipment for their various programme needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All AVA students are trained in relevant digital literacy and technological
skills, such as AI, coding, and robotics, during weekly CCA training sessions.
Selected students also participate in relevant competitions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the execution of these duties, students develop a wide range of
skills related to the audio-visual field and emerging technologies, which
are applicable not only in their daily lives but also in their future aspirations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moreover, they embody and demonstrate the school values of <strong>Respect</strong> for
others, <strong>Responsibility</strong> in carrying out their duties, <strong>Resilience</strong> in
problem-solving involving AI, coding, and robotics, and <strong>Synergy</strong> across
juniors and seniors within the CCA.

<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Oneida Scouts&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The East Spring Oneida Scout Group has been
established since the founding of the school in 1999. Since its inception,
the Scouts Unit in East Spring Secondary has become a mainstay in the school’s
educational programmes, developing our Scouts holistically through a selection
of outdoor and team activities. The Scouting Movement is part of a worldwide
movement of young people consisting of more than 40 million members. Through
a comprehensive programme, Scouting aims to offer opportunities for young
people to develop and nurture values, confidence and character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our weekly CCA programme is based on the Patrol system – a platform
where teams of young people, consisting of Secondary 1 to 3 students, plan
and execute their own variety of activities to promote an exciting and
enjoyable Scouting experience. These Patrols also regularly work together
on Unit level activities, such as annual camps, hikes, Pioneering and Backwoodsman
cooking. This combination of activities aims to help Scouts learn and live
values through working with peers of different backgrounds and engage in
cross-cultural experiences to experience Group Life in an outdoor learning
experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Scouts also have programmes at the national level, where Scouts
meet Scouts from other schools and collaborate on activities, from traditional
scoutcraft to sporting activities. This can manifest in annual Leadership
courses, the bi-annual National Patrol Camp, to the highly popular National
Jamboree where they have a chance to meet Scouts from other countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“An individual step in character training is to put responsibility
on the individual.” Baden-Powell, Founder of Scouting</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Patrol system is designed to offer opportunities for character
training by allowing as many chances for responsibility suited for the
young person. At the Unit Level, a Scout can look forward to taking charge
of smaller duties at the Patrol level such as a Patrol Quartermaster to
taking on more formal roles such as:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assistant Patrol Leader: one who assists the Patrol
Leader to run the weekly programmes and other areas, such as logistics,
planning and discipline of the Patrol</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrol Leader: one who works with other Patrol Leaders
to plan and execute the weekly programmes under the guidance of the teachers
and adult volunteers. They are also seen to be the role model of the Patrol
and act with the role of the eldest sibling in the family.</p>
<p>Senior Patrol Leader: one who represents the council of Patrol Leaders
and works directly with the teachers and adult volunteers for better communication
and coordination of the Scout Troop.</p>

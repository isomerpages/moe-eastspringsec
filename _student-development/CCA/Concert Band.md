<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Concert Band</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The East Spring Concert Band (ESB) comprises
about 50 members from the Woodwind, Brass and Percussion families, representing
a wide range of instruments across these three groups. Under the direction
of our Main Band Conductor, Mr Hoe Kong Foo, and Junior Band Conductor,
Mr Tan Aik Koon, the band fosters a supportive and purposeful environment
for students to grow in musical skill, core values, and personal confidence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2025, ESB represented the school at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts
Presentation (SYF AP), performing <em>Overture No. 1</em> by Dr Kelly Tang
and <em>Air Force One</em> by William Owens. Through focused preparation,
resilience, and synergy, the band exemplified their motto “One Band, One
Sound” and earned the Certificate of Commendation. Additional experiences,
such as an inter-school exchange and a school showcase, further strengthened
members’ performance exposure and camaraderie.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Student leadership is built progressively in ESB. Senior members may also
take on Executive Committee roles where they support section management,
assist with rehearsals and concert preparations, and, for selected leaders,
conduct the band for certain pieces. They also work with the band teacher
to strengthen belonging and ensure smooth operations. Junior members focus
on developing instrumental and ensemble skills.</p>

Presentation: Certificate of Commendation</p>

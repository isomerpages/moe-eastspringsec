<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Netball</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br>East Spring Netball (ESNB</strong>) is committed to
nurture young women with a passion for excellence, both on and off the
court. We believe in developing our girls holistically and supporting them
in achieving their fullest potential in academic and non-academic pursuits.
Through our training programmes, we emphasise values such as responsibility,
respect, integrity, character, and teamwork. ESNB strives to shape our
players into confident, resilient, and well-rounded individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our team participates actively in various competitions each year, including
the National School Games ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Championships, Daisy Tan
Carnival, and the Deloitte PESTA Sukan Carnival among others. Beyond competitions,
our students are also given opportunities to explore and grow their leadership
potential. They are encouraged to contribute ideas to improve CCA sessions,
and are guided to plan, execute, and review initiatives such as bonding
activities and CCA camps.</p>

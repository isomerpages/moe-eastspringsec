<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Netball</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>East Spring Netball (ESNB) is built on a strong legacy of young women who have a passion for excellence both on and off the court. We believe in holistic development for all the girls and work towards achieving their full potential, both in academic and non-academic pursuits. We emphasize the importance of responsibility, respect, integrity, character and team work through a myriad of programmes in our trainings. ESNB aims to develop these young women to be confident and excellent individuals.</p>
<p>We take part in a number of competitions each year, including the National Schools Games ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Competitions, Daisy Tan Carnival, Deloitte PESTA Sukan Carnival, M1 Netball Challenge amongst others. Students are also given the opportunity to develop and realize their latent leadership potential as they are invited to provide input into how to improve CCA sessions. They are also guided to plan, execute and review activities like bonding sessions and VIA projects.</p>

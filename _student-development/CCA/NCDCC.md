<p><strong>CCA Name: <br></strong>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC)</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The East Spring National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (ES NCDCC) unit was formed in 2006 and aims to develop young cadets to learn and practice their skills diligently, lead their juniors with confidence and serve the community with care.</p>
<p>In Year 1, our cadets are equipped with basic skills such as Fire Safety, Total Defence and Basic Foot Drills. Upon completion, cadets get promoted to Lance Corporal by the end of Year 1. In Year 2, our cadets learn life-saving skills such as First Aid, Rescue, Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and operating the Automated External Defibrillator (AED). Cadets also learn Advanced Foot Drills, Civil Defence Knowledge and attend the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) course. Upon completion, cadets get promoted to Sergeant by the end of Year 2. In Year 3, our cadets learn about Hazardous Materials and Homefront Security. They also choose a specialization course in Fire Safety, Medical Response or Urban Search and Rescue. Upon completion, cadets get promoted to Staff Sergeant by the end of Year 3.</p>
<p>Along the way cadets are groomed to be outstanding leaders of character and are given opportunities and platforms to in turn, train and groom the younger cadets. The very best cadets graduate as Warrant Officers in Year 4.</p>
<p>Our key competitions include Precision Drill Competition (PDC), Inter-Unit Quiz (IUQ) and Urban Adventure Civil Defence Challenge (UACDC).</p>
<p>Highlights of the CCA include visits to the Fire Station, Dart Base, and Emergency Preparedness Centre. Cadets also have a chance to take part in National Events such as the NDP marching contingent, performing first aid duty for the Chingay Parade as well as Overseas Learning Journeys.</p>

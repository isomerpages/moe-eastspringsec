<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Chinese Dance</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>At East Spring Chinese Dance (ESCD), we are
firmly rooted in the belief of nurturing and developing every student to
his or her fullest potential. Our dancers embody elegance, grace and discipline,
reflecting both technical excellence and artistic expression.</p>
<p>Our dedicated team of teachers and professional instructors takes pride
in providing meaningful opportunities for dancers to showcase their talents
at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and other competitions and school
events. Through these platforms, students gain valuable performance experience
and grow in confidence and stage presence.</p>
<p>Under professional guidance, dancers are exposed to a diverse repertoire
of dance styles, continuously challenging themselves to achieve excellence
in every performance. They cultivate flexibility, poise and a refined sense
of aesthetics in movement. Throughout the preparation process, students
also learn perseverance, teamwork and commitment — values that strengthen
both their character and their bonds as a team. As a result of this strong
culture of participation and unity, our graduating dancers consistently
attain excellent CCA achievements.</p>
<p>Leadership development is an integral part of ESSS Chinese Dance. All
members are given opportunities and guidance to exercise leadership in
various capacities. Outstanding dancers who demonstrate strong leadership
qualities may also be selected to attend national-level leadership training
programmes.</p>
<p>In ESSS Chinese Dance, we are committed not only to artistic excellence
but also to the holistic development of our students, nurturing both skill
and character.</p>

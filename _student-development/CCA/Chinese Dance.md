<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Chinese Dance</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>ESSS Chinese Dance is firmly rooted in the belief of nurturing and developing each student to his/her fullest potential. ESSS Chinese Dancers are the perfect embodiment of elegance, grace and style. The committed team of teachers take pride in providing valuable opportunities for the Chinese dancers to showcase their talent through the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and other competitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the professional guidance of our dedicated instructors, our dancers have benefited from the exposure to a repertoire of different dance styles and are always driven to achieve excellence in every performance. Our students embrace a culture of excellence in terms of flexibility, poise and a heightened sense of aesthetics in dance movement. During the preparatory phases, our students learn the importance of teamwork and commitment. With such a strong culture of active participation with strong team spirit, all of our graduating dancers have obtained excellent CCA results.</p>
<p>Leadership development is a key aspect of the CCA and all dancers are provided with guidance and platforms to exercise their leadership. Moreover, exceptional dancers who exhibit outstanding leadership qualities will be further given the opportunity to attend a leadership training camp at the national level.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CCA Name: <br></strong>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC)</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>The East Spring National Civil Defence Cadet
Corps (ES NCDCC) unit was formed in 2006 and aims to develop young cadets
to learn and practise their skills diligently, lead their juniors with
confidence, and serve the community with care. Upholding the motto “<strong>We Learn, We Lead, We Serve</strong>.”,
the NCDCC experience reflects the three core stages of a cadet’s journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Year 1, cadets are equipped with foundational skills such as Fire Safety,
Total Defence, and Basic Foot Drills. Upon completion, cadets are promoted
to Lance Corporal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Year 2, cadets learn essential life-saving skills including First Aid,
Rescue, Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), and operating the Automated
External Defibrillator (AED). They also undergo Advanced Foot Drills, Civil
Defence Knowledge, and the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA)
course. Upon completion, cadets are promoted to Sergeant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Year 3, cadets expand their learning to Hazardous Materials and Homefront
Security. They also choose a specialization course in Fire Safety, Medical
Response, or Urban Search and Rescue. Upon completion, cadets are promoted
to Staff Sergeant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout their journey, cadets are groomed to become leaders of character,
taking on mentorship roles to train and inspire their juniors. The very
best cadets graduate as Warrant Officers in Year 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, the ES NCDCC unit has collaborated closely with the Singapore
Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and various community partners such as the People’s
Association and grassroots committees to raise awareness about emergency
preparedness and community resilience. These engagements aim to equip members
of the public with the skills and knowledge to respond effectively to emergencies
and build a stronger, more resilient community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activities include demonstrations and hands-on learning, such as fire
extinguisher usage, CPR and AED training, and first-aid improvisation.
Cadets also conduct public education talks on topics such as the Public
Warning System, identifying nearby civil defence shelters, and preparing
emergency “ready bags.” These activities strengthen community networks
and promote neighbourly preparedness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond training, cadets participate in major events such as the NCDCC
Annual Parade at the Home Team Academy, as well as key competitions like
the Precision Drill Competition (PDC), Inter-Unit Quiz (IUQ), and Urban
Adventure Civil Defence Challenge (UACDC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCA highlights include visits to the Fire Station, DART Base, and Emergency
Preparedness Centre. Cadets also take part in national events such as the
National Day Parade marching contingent, first aid duties at the Chingay
Parade, and Overseas Exchange Visits (OEV).</p>

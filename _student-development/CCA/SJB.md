<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>St John Brigade (SJB)</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>St John Brigade is the uniformed branch of St John Singapore, which trains our cadets on extensive First Aid and Home Nursing knowledge and skills through our Cadet programme.</p>
<p>Our cadet programme, which integrates essential first aid and home nursing skills together with community service, badge programmes, leadership development, and character-building, is based on the Ministry of Education’s approach of developing 21st-century core competencies through character and citizenship education.</p>
<p>Through St John, our members have grown to become resilient and compassionate leaders who are ready to contribute to their community. Several of our alumni have professional careers in Singapore’s healthcare sector as nurses and allied healthcare workers. Many of them continue to volunteer with St John, sharing their passion with a future generation.</p>
<p>The St John Brigade East Spring Corps comprises two units, the Nursing Unit for female cadets and the Ambulance Unit for male cadets. The Brigade trains and equips our cadets with skills in the areas of First Aid, Home Nursing, Transportation of Casualties, Footdrills, Camp-craft as well as Leadership skills. It is through these weekly training sessions that our cadets develop into independent, disciplined, resilient and responsible individuals, so that they can be better prepared for the numerous future life challenges ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Our Achievements:<br></strong>Corps Achievement Award – Silver 2017, 2018, 2019</p>

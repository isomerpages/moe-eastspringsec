<p>Our unit has successfully sustained its Unit Overall Proficiency Award
(UOPA) Distinction Award for four consecutive years from 2021 to 2024,
and the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) Gold Award for eight consecutive
years from 2012 - 2019. On top of that, since 2013, seventeen of our cadet
leaders have received the pinnacle badge in NPCC, the SPF-NPCC Badge, from
the Commissioner of Police.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, ESSS NPCC has collaborated with various external
organisations which allow cadets to be actively involved in various Values-In
Action (VIA) projects such as the NPCC Police Youth Ambassador (PYA) programme
to spread the anti-crime and SG-Secure preparedness messages to the residents
in the neighbourhood. Besides that, cadets also participated in major parades
such as the NPCC Annual Parade at the Home Team Academy. Enrichment programmes
such as Unarmed Tactics and First Aid are some of the engaging activities
that cadets can look forward to participating.</p>
<p>Authentic learning experience in the NPCC unit are not only confined to
the local context. Throughout the years, the unit has actively organised
Overseas Learning Journeys (OLJs) to neighbouring countries such as Kahang
(Johore), Bintan (Indonesia), Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam) and Hanoi (Vietnam).
Our cadets have also participated in OLJs to Hong Kong and Brunei that
were organised by NPCC HQ.</p>
<p>Cadets were also given the opportunity to represent the school in the
various National Inter-unit Competitions such as Revolver Shooting Competition,
Crime Scene Investigation Competition, Campcraft Competition, Footdrills
Competition and Area6 Games (Sports) Day.</p>

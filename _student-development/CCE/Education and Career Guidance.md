<p><em>EDUCATION &amp; CAREER GUIDANCE</em>
</p>
<p>At East Spring Secondary School, our Education and Career Guidance (ECG)
initiatives help students discover their purpose, strengths, and interests.&nbsp;We
nurture our students’ self-awareness, growth mindset, resilience and adaptability
to develop their future potential and career readiness.</p>

students to learn in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers
of different strengths and interests.</p>

<p><strong>Direct School Admission (DSA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements
and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE). Primary 6 (P6) students who do not participate in the
DSA-Sec will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE results through
the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.</p>

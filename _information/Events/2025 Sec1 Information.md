<p>Students are to report in full school uniform at the parade square on
the first day of school by <strong>7.20 am</strong>. If you do not have
the ESSS uniform, your child can report in his/her primary school’s full
uniform.</p>
<p>There will be student leaders and signages to guide the students to the
reporting area. In the event of wet weather, students will report directly
to the assigned classrooms at the first level.</p>

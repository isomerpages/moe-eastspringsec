Two groups of three teachers and ten Secondary 3 East Springians went on a memorable overseas learning journey, spending four days and three nights in Vietnam, immersed themselves in this educational and industrial experience. These students were selected to explore the field of STEM after a rigorous selection process.

One of the two groups headed to the capital of Vietnam, Hanoi. First up, we visited the Hoa Lo prison, nicknamed "Hanoi Hilton" by US prisoners of war.  Next, we visited the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP). We had the golden opportunity to speak with the Head of Marketing of Bac Ninh VSIP.  She provided various insights into the park's beginnings and how the park remains sustainable. We also visited other companies such as FPT Hanoi, Honda Vietnam, and TEKY. FPT is one of the largest information technology service companies in Vietnam, and Teky Academy, where students learn aspects such as coding, programming and robotics.

In addition to these industrial visits, we also explored various historical and cultural sites in Hanoi. These included the Temple of Literature, Train Street, Hoan Kiem Lake, St. Joseph's Church, the Old Quarters, and a Water Puppet show at the Thang Long Theatre.

The other group set out for the city named after Vietnam's founding father, Ho Chi Minh. We visited the Cu Chi Tunnels, where remnants of the Vietnam War could be found. We also visited the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP) in Ho Chi Minh and spoke with the Head of Marketing for Binh Duong I, who shared insights into how efficiently and effectively VSIP is managed.  Additionally, we visited the Yakult factory that was located in VSIP. As a whole, we learnt about how Vietnam managed to industrialize and become a rising powerhouse in Asia and even the world.

In a nutshell, the journeys undertaken by the two groups of East Springians in Vietnam have been eye-opening experiences that left a lasting mark on our perspectives. These experiences have instilled values of empathy and resilience in us, which ties back to our school values.

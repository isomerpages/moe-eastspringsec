<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To develop in East Springians critical thinking skills and a greater awareness of the world, past and present</p>
<h4><strong>Goals</strong></h4>
<p>We want our students to stay rooted as they think global in the future.</p>
<p>Especially in this day and age, we also want to take guidance from Professor Tommy Koh who said - "<em>We want our humanists to understand technology and our technologists to understand the humanities.</em></p>
<p><em>An education in the humanities train us to think, write and speak clearly.&nbsp;<br></em></p>
<p><em>As long as we are human beings, the humanities will always be at the heart of civilisation.</em>"</p>
<h4><strong>Innovative Programmes / Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>Our key pedagogy is Inquiry-based Learning, and we carry out Geographical Investigations, Historical Investigations and Issue Investigations in the learning of Geography, History and Social Studies.</p>
<p>We strive to incorporate more discussion-based learning as well as self-directed, self-paced learning in our lessons.</p>
<p>We develop a four-year plan to help cultivate thinking skills in East Springians.</p>

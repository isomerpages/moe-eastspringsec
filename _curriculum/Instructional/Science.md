<h4><strong>Goals</strong></h4>
<p>At East Spring, the Science Department believes that every student can learn, and that learning Science is best through a multi-modal approach. Therefore, our Science Curriculum is specially designed to provide opportunities for our students throughout their four to five years of secondary education to learn about the fast changing world around them through the use of inquiry based pedagogical approach such as the 5E instructional model as well as scientific method that involves hypothesis testing, observation, analysis of data and conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our passionate Science teachers are not only keen to share with our students their passion for learning of Science but also seek to empower our students with relevant skills and tools to know, understand and appreciate the role of Science in their daily life, society and environment.</p>

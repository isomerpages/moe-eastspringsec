<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">To nurture East Springians to be self-directed, compassionate citizens with a passion for excellence and&nbsp;life-long learning&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">At East Spring Secondary School, we strive to enable all students to uncover their strengths and experience success, through a holistic curriculum&nbsp;anchored on innovative teaching and learning, as well as solid character and student leadership development. Aimed at moulding students into&nbsp;future-ready learners, teaching and learning experiences are designed to promote inquiry and application in real world contexts, leveraging&nbsp;technology to stimulate students’ curiosity and thinking. Character education and leadership development, infused in the school’s CCE lessons&nbsp;and co-curriculum, are built on the belief that every student can be progressively developed into a leader of self and person of influence who&nbsp;makes a difference to the community. These outcomes are made possible with the commitment of a nurturing and synergistic staff, as well as the&nbsp;support and collaboration of parents and external partners. Through the diverse learning opportunities provided by the school, we are confident&nbsp;that every East Springian will emerge as a creative learner, upright leader and global thinker to meet the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century.</p>

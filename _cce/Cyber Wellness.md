<p>The&nbsp;main objective of our&nbsp;Cyber&nbsp;Wellness (CW)&nbsp;Committee is to equip students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible users of Information Communications Technology (ICT). We also wish to&nbsp;create a healthy&nbsp;cyber&nbsp;identity and positive&nbsp;cyber&nbsp;citizenship among East Springians.&nbsp;The teaching of Cyber Wellness is crucial to guide our students to embrace ICT and yet maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and cyber world.</p>
<p>To achieve the desirable outcomes mentioned, the team has planned various activities to ensure a holistic approach in spreading&nbsp;Cyber&nbsp;Wellness&nbsp;efforts across the school. Listed below are the activities planned for 2019.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Cyber&nbsp;Wellness&nbsp;Activities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explicit teaching of Cyber Wellness Guidance Modules throughout the year during SFL periods</li>
<li>Sharing by Cyber Wellness Ambassadors during Power of Positive Thinking (PPE) sessions</li>
<li>Sharing of slides on CW messages with the students</li>
<li>Cyber Wellness Week (Customised CCE Lesson for RISE periods and booths set up during recess)</li>
</ul>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Appointment of Cyber Wellness Ambassadors</strong></p>
<p>To empower our students to lead in&nbsp;Cyber&nbsp;Wellness&nbsp;efforts, all classes are represented by 1&nbsp;Cyber&nbsp;Wellness&nbsp;Ambassador. The CW Ambassador will advocate CW efforts planned for the school as well as participate in external CW events.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Resources for Parents and Students</strong></p>
<p>Ministry of Education has recently launched a Facebook page as well as a Youtube Channel to share useful resources on Cyber Wellness. The resources are available for both educators and parents. The&nbsp;ICT Connection page is also another resourceful website that provides a list of guides and tips, resources and useful links to help parents reinforce Cyber Wellness education at home. The links are as follows:</p>

#### INTRODUCTION

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work. The goals of ECG are to support students in:

**Discovering Purpose – Who am I?**

Nurture students’ self-awareness to support them in discovering how they can meaningfully play a part in their community

**Exploring Opportunities – Where do I want to go?**

Develop students’ self-directedness and confidence to explore and leverage education and career opportunities while respecting the value of all occupations

**Staying Relevant – How do I get there?**

Build students’ adaptability and resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning

#### ECG COUNSELLING

We have an ECG Counsellor to provide support to students (individually or in small groups). Students who would like to explore more in areas such as subject choices, course options or to find out more about their strengths and interests can have a chat with our school’s ECG Counsellor.

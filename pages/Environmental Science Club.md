<p><strong>CCA Name:<br></strong>Green Club</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA:<br></strong>Green Club originated with the objective of providing a holistic values-based environmental education. It seeks to equip its members with the necessary 21CC skills by developing self-directed learners and compassionate citizens, which is also in line with the schoolâ€™s vision and mission.</p>
<p>Green Club members play an active role as Environmental Champions to promote environmental awareness within and beyond the school community. Students are given the opportunity to lead and organise service learning projects encompassing environmental sustainability. Using the Service Learning Model, students are closely guided through the various stages of planning, organisation, implementation and a structured reflection process.</p>
<p>Our students are engaged in a variety of environmental conservation activities, from upcycling and terrarium-making workshops to some research on local flora and fauna. Our students are also actively involved in maintaining the school environment, such as maintaining our vertical garden and the water and electricity conservation posters in the school.</p>
<p>All in all, Green Club hopes to develop environmental advocates who will ultimately possess a sense of responsibility towards the environment and forge a life-long habit to serve Mother Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activities/Events:<br></strong>Learning Journey to Garden By the Bay<br>Tampines Tree Planting Carnival<br>Moss Terrarium Workshop</p>

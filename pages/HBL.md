<h3><strong>Home-Based Learning / Blended Learning</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Home-Based Learning</strong></h4>
<p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, schools have implemented a strict regime of precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being of our staff and students. To support further safe distancing, schools will progressively transit to a blended learning model.</p>
<p><strong>TIPS TO SUPPORT YOUR CHILD IN SECONDARY SCHOOL</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Guide your child to get ready</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Set up an area conducive for learning, such as at the dining table or study desk. This should not be where your child sleeps!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Make sure your child is familiar with and has the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol type="a">
<li>Passwords and Login IDs: Access to the online portals that the school will be using (e.g. SLS), and he/she has taken note of the login details.</li>
<li>HBL timetable and relevant materials: Check that your child knows the schedule and has the materials he/she needs to complete his/her work.</li>
<li>Point of contact for HBL queries: Teachers will inform your child about their preferred mode of communication - they are not required to share their mobile numbers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Make sure your child has access to the following tools:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol type="a">
<li>Digital tools available on different platforms (e.g. annotation function on SLS, whiteboard function on Zoom)</li>
<li>Digital shortcuts (e.g. use bookmark or folders for electronic learning materials for easy access)</li>
<li>Note-taking techniques (e.g. make notes, list questions that arise during HBL and organise them by subjects for clarification back in school or over e-consultation with teachers)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Agree on a structure</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Unlike in school, an adult may not always be present to supervise your child. It is important to establish a routine with them on:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol type="a">
<li>Study, meal and rest timings</li>
<li>"School" time (e.g. change out of pyjamas before starting HBL)</li>
<li>"Recess" time (e.g. healthy, balanced diets)</li>
<li>Recreation time (e.g. 15 mins after completing each subject)</li>
<li>Recreational activities at home (e.g. reading story books, craft work, exercise)</li>
<li>Recreational activities online (e.g. decide how much time he/she should spend online, behave responsibly online)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Have regular check-ins</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">At the end of the day, have a conversation with your child about his/her experience. You can talk about:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol type="a">
<li>The HBL experience: How was his/her day? What did he/she learn? Was it difficult/manageable? Would he/she need to tweak the learning area/routine? What other support would he/she require? Any queries that he/she may wish to speak to the teachers on but not sure how to go about doing it?</li>
<li>The Covid-19 situation: How does he/she feel about the current situation with Covid-19? How is he/she feeling about being away from his/her friends? Does he/she have any questions about Covid-19?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">It is okay if you don't have the answers - look for the answers and learn together! Affirm him/her for adapting and showing the spirit of resilience.</p>
<p><strong>4. Remind your child to stay at home</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For working parents, do remind your child to stay at home, so that he/she can remain safe, minimise any exposure to the coronavirus and practise social responsibility.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol type="a">
<li>Remain at home as much as possible</li>
<li>Minimise visitors to the house</li>
<li>Minimise time spent in public places and contact with others</li>
<li>Monitor his/her health and temperature</li>
<li>Follow his/her HBL plan closely to continue with learning</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

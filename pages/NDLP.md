<h4><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>At MOE&rsquo;s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. This letter provides important information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform &ndash; the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) &ndash; as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students&rsquo; learning. This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education (MOE)&rsquo;s Digital Literacy Framework:</p>

<h4><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></h4>
<p>The DMA setting during school hours will be determined by the school, with parents/guardians given a choice to opt for alternative DMA settings after school hours. The following table outlines the different levels of restrictions, controls and monitoring for the different DMA options after school hours.</p>

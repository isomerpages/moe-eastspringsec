<h4><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>At MOE&rsquo;s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. This letter provides important information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform &ndash; the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) &ndash; as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students&rsquo; learning. This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education (MOE)&rsquo;s Digital Literacy Framework:</p>

<h4><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></h4>
<p>The DMA setting during school hours will be determined by the school, with parents/guardians given a choice to opt for alternative DMA settings after school hours. The following table outlines the different levels of restrictions, controls and monitoring for the different DMA options after school hours.

<h4><strong>Use of Edusave</strong></h4>
<p>The cost of the device bundle can be paid using your child's Edusave account, after setting aside provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>To ensure the affordability of devices, there was a one-time Edusave top-up of $200 in April 2020 to support the purchase of the device. This is on top of the annual $290 credited into the Edusave account for Secondary School students. Most Singapore Citizen students would have sufficient funds in the Edusave account after the top-up. Should the Edusave funds be insufficient, cash out-of-pocket would be kept low.</p>
<h4><strong>Financial Assistance</strong></h4>
<p>For students on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket will be $0.</p>
<p>Additional subsidies are available for students who need financial assistance, and that parents should approach the ESSS General Office for more information.</p>
<h4><strong>Roll-Out of IT Applications as part of National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital to students&rsquo; learning experience and educational journey. In the following months, the school will roll out some or all of the following applications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Student iCON</strong>: MOE will give every secondary school student an email address. This is a service provided by Google as part of Google Suite.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Pro Plus</strong>: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Every secondary school student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 mins time limit using the Student iCON for the students&rsquo; video conferencing needs.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p><strong>How do we purchase the device through the school?<br /></strong>Purchase of the device can be made through the school at this link: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can my child not purchase the personal learning device (PLD)? Can we use our own device?<br /></strong>Every student is required to have a PLD for teaching and learning purposes and is encouraged to purchase one through the school via MOE&rsquo;s bulk tender procured at discounted prices. Students are strongly encouraged to use the PLD model prescribed by the school, as the uniformity of systems and software would ensure a smooth learning experience for everyone. The PLD purchased through the school will come with the necessary warranty and insurance as well.</p>
<p>We encourage all to use the model prescribed by the school for a smooth learning experience. The device purchased through the school will come with the necessary warranty and insurance as well. If students wish to use their own devices, they must meet the necessary specifications stated by the school.</p>
<p>Please email the school (<a href="mailto:esss@moe.edu.sg" target="">esss@moe.edu.sg</a>), with the subject &lsquo;Use of Own Device for PDLP&rsquo;, with the following information:</p>
<p>Name and Class of child/ward<br />Name and contact number of parent/guardian<br />Reason/s for using own device</p>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p id="4"><strong>Do all students in a school have to use the same PLD? What about students who opt out of using the school-selected PLD and wish to use their own? How will this affect their learning?<br /></strong>Students are strongly encouraged to use the PLD model prescribed by the school for a smooth learning experience. If students wish to use their own devices, these devices must meet the necessary specifications stated by the school.&nbsp;If parents have questions about the devices, they can approach their child&rsquo;s teachers or HOD/ICT for assistance.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p id="5"><strong>Can students share one PLD with their siblings?<br /></strong>For a smooth learning experience, it is strongly encouraged that each student has his/her own PLD as prescribed by the school. This is because different schools may tap on specific PLD for teaching and learning. In addition, the student will be required to use the PLD in school daily and for their learning after school, hence it might not be practical to share the PLD with their siblings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="6"><strong>Is the price of the PLD similar or lower than market prices?<br /></strong>The prices are similar or in most cases, lower than market prices. MOE has a process to review the prices with contractors to keep the prices competitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="7"><strong>Will the PLD and SLS resources replace textbooks?<br /></strong>With the PLD, this allows students to access curriculum-aligned resources in the SLS in and out of class at their own pace to complement their learning. The PLD and SLS resources will not fully replace textbooks as textbooks are currently designed as curriculum-aligned reference for students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="8"><strong>How frequently will the PLD be used in class? Is there a recommended limit to screen time in class?<br /></strong>There is no recommended screen time as it depends very much on the nature of the activity. According to the American Academy of Paediatrics (2016), there is no one-size-fits-all approach to limiting the amount of screen time for teenagers. The academy recommends that screen time takes into consideration a child&rsquo;s developmental stage, how the technology is used, and the quality of the content and design of the material. Schools will design their learning programmes to ensure that the students&rsquo; use of PLDs is balanced in relation to other activities and modes of learning.</p>
<p>Teachers will also continue to ensure that the amount of assignments set (both online and offline) is guided by the school&rsquo;s homework policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="9"><strong>Where do we collect the device after the purchase?<br /></strong>The school will make arrangements for students to collect their devices in the school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions about the Personal Learning Device (PLD)</strong></p>
<ol start = "10">
<li>
<p><strong>What is the battery life for the laptops?<br /></strong>The battery of a fully charged device will be sufficient for a typical day of school activities, with a mixture of active use and idle periods. Students are to ensure their PLDs are fully charged at home before bringing them to school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the expected shelf life of the PLD? What happens to the PLD after the student graduates?<br /></strong>The PLDs have an average shelf life of 3-4 years, to cover the time a student is in a secondary school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions about the Warranty, Insurance and Security</strong></p>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p><strong>What is covered by the insurance?</strong><br />The PLD will come with a 3-year warranty and insurance coverage allowing for claims of two repairs or one replacement. The following events are covered by insurance:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What happens if the device is stolen/lost?<br /></strong>The insurance coverage is only applicable to situations of damages and loss where the student has taken all necessary precautions to safeguard the PLD. A police report will need to be made for the insurance claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Does a police report need to be made if a student loses his/her PLD due to negligence?<br /></strong>Accidental loss due to negligence in not covered by insurance and a new PLD will need to be purchased by the parent. The school will assist in purchasing a replacement PLD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What if the PLD is faulty?<br /></strong>Technical support will be provided to students through:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Service-desk set up in school during breaks and after school on a weekly basis (till 4.00 p.m. on weekdays)</li>
<li>Lenovo Service Centre(3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre, Singapore 369522)</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What happens if students damage their PLD accidentally?<br /></strong>If the PLD is damaged, the parents/student can report it to the school. The school will coordinate with the vendor on the assessment of damage and repairs.</p>
<p>If there are additional costs incurred, the vendor will contact the parents/student before proceeding with the repair. All additional costs for repairs will be borne by the parents/student if not covered by insurance.</p>
<p>Edusave funds cannot be used to pay for the cost of repairs.</p>
<p>If the device is damaged beyond economical repair and is not covered by insurance (coverage against damage and loss/theft), the replacement device will have to be paid for by the parents/student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Would it not be better if the devices could be insured/have a warranty period of 4 years as a standard?<br /></strong>Extended warranty beyond 3 years for computing devices is not available in the open market. It would be very costly to incorporate such a requirement and it makes more economical sense to replace the device when it is beyond economical repair after 3 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where will students store their PLDs when they go for recess or PE lessons? Will students be allowed to store the PLDs in school overnight?<br /></strong>The school has installed lockers for students to store their valuables. Students are expected to secure their PLDs in the lockers when they are away from their classrooms. Students should bring home the PLDs at the end of the school day so that they can utilise the PLDs for learning at home as well as charge them for use the next day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions about Edusave, Subsidies and Payment</strong></p>
<ol start="19">
<li>
<p><strong>Can students use their Edusave Fund to purchase PLDs from vendors not engaged by the school?<br /></strong>Edusave fund can only be used for purchases facilitated by the school through MOE&rsquo;s bulk tender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do we check the amount of Edusave fund available in our child&rsquo;s/ward&rsquo;s (for Singapore Citizens) account?<br /></strong>You can call 6260 0777 (24-hour automated hotline) to check your child's/ward's Edusave balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can the 2020 Edusave top-up of $200 only be used for the purchase of the PLD?<br /></strong>Although the one-time Edusave top-up of $200 in April 2020 is not ring-fenced for the purchase of the PLD, its intent is to enhance the affordability of PLDs for students. Parents are thus encouraged to draw down on the Edusave funds to offset the purchase of PLDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Can Edusave be used to pay for purchase of accessories/peripherals for the PLD?<br /></strong>Edusave can only be purchased for accessories/peripherals that are bundled with the initial PLD. Edusave cannot be used for individual&rsquo;s purchase of optional accessories / peripherals from the vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For students whose parents do not want schools to deduct their Edusave for the purchase of PLDs, can they pay cash instead?<br /></strong>It is compulsory for all MOE FAS students to use their Edusave to purchase the PLDs. This authorization is already covered in the 2021 FAS application form.</p>
<p>School-Based FAS students are strongly encouraged to sign up for the PDLP Standing Order so as to minimize the cash outlay.</p>
<p>For Singapore Citizen students who are not under MOE FAS or School Based FAS, parents may choose not to use the Edusave and pay the amount through AXS/AXS mobile app/cash upon receiving the school bill. Parents opting to pay cash and are onboard GIRO should ensure sufficient amount in their bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If we are not eligible for subsidy but have enough Edusave fund, do we still need to top up cash?<br /></strong>If there is sufficient funds in the Edusave account to purchase the PLD, there is no need to top up with cash.</p>
</li>
</ol>

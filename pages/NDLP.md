<h4><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>At MOE&rsquo;s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. This letter provides important information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform &ndash; the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) &ndash; as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students&rsquo; learning. This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education (MOE)&rsquo;s Digital Literacy Framework:</p>

<h4><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></h4>
<p>The DMA setting during school hours will be determined by the school, with parents/guardians given a choice to opt for alternative DMA settings after school hours. The following table outlines the different levels of restrictions, controls and monitoring for the different DMA options after school hours.</p>

<h4><strong>Use of Edusave</strong></h4>
<p>The cost of the device bundle can be paid using your child's Edusave account, after setting aside provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>To ensure the affordability of devices, there was a one-time Edusave top-up of $200 in April 2020 to support the purchase of the device. This is on top of the annual $290 credited into the Edusave account for Secondary School students. Most Singapore Citizen students would have sufficient funds in the Edusave account after the top-up. Should the Edusave funds be insufficient, cash out-of-pocket would be kept low.</p>
<h4><strong>Financial Assistance</strong></h4>
<p>For students on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket will be $0.</p>
<p>Additional subsidies are available for students who need financial assistance, and that parents should approach the ESSS General Office for more information.</p>
<h4><strong>Roll-Out of IT Applications as part of National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital to students&rsquo; learning experience and educational journey. In the following months, the school will roll out some or all of the following applications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Student iCON</strong>: MOE will give every secondary school student an email address. This is a service provided by Google as part of Google Suite.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Pro Plus</strong>: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Every secondary school student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 mins time limit using the Student iCON for the students&rsquo; video conferencing needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Schools may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above. The school will need to use your child&rsquo;s/ward&rsquo;s personal data such as his/her name and class to set up user accounts. Please refer to our&nbsp;<strong><a href="/ndlp#FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a></strong>&nbsp;section for more information on the collection of data via these applications.</p>

On the 21st of September, our school's graduation hall echoed with the soft hum of nostalgia, pride, and bittersweet farewells. The theme of "Inside Out" was not just a nod to the heartwarming Pixar movie, but an intimate reflection of our emotional journey over the years—capturing the essence of their growth, the pain of parting, and the anxiety of the unknown future.

As the graduates walked into the hall, each was greeted with a graduation bear— a symbol of our school's love and pride for each student. The bear, a gift from our school, serves as a gentle reminder that no matter where they go, the spirit of their alma mater will always be with them.

The photobooth corner buzzed with excitement, providing a space for graduates to capture this momentous day - the smiles, the tears, and everything in between. Friends and teachers crowded in, making sure to get that perfect shot to look back on in the years to come.

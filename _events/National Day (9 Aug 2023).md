ESSS commemorated National Day on the 8th of August 2023. The celebrations started with the Uniformed Groups March-in ceremony coupled with our Concert Band providing the live accompaniment. The day continued with classroom lessons, which guided our lower secondary students to think about whether the best way to foster a sense of belonging to Singapore was to celebrate National Day. Our upper secondary students discussed ways we could strengthen our identity as Singaporeans as we move ‘Onward as One’, which was also the theme of this year’s National Day celebrations.
  
The students also had an opportunity to pen down or illustrate their well wishes for Singapore’s 58th birthday. As they munched on local kuehs, they also reflected on the different significance behind the creation of these delicacies.
  
Decked out in red, the whole school gathered in the school hall for a live concert. As the students pondered over the video presentations by the Minister of Education and Recollections video, took part enthusiastically in the ‘Don’t Forget the Lyrics’ game show, and sang in harmony during the Singalong session, we are hopeful that these events will inevitably imprint the importance of social cohesion and a will to act for the future of Singapore.

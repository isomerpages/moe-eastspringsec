On 19th July this year, our school organised the inaugural school carnival. 

This event was a meaningful experience for all of us from the start. Students were expected to run games, food, and jewellery stalls. Through the running of these stalls, it taught us students about the valuable skills that will be useful in our future endeavours. We learned to manage finances and develop pricing strategies and publicity plans. In addition, the carnival was a platform to hone our communication skills as the students had to manage the entire school population.

Personally, I had a fun time with my friends attending the different stalls, and I could just stroll and visit the different stalls at my own pace. There were many stalls put up by different classes and CCAs, and I was pleasantly surprised that they could come up with ideas that made their stalls unique. One particular stall that I loved was the jewellery stall, where we could design our own. My friends and I made a few rings with very unique designs. In addition, there were game stalls too. I tried out a few. The prizes that were given out were pretty nice, too. 

In conclusion, this carnival provided a stellar opportunity for us East Springians to explore our leadership potential. I hope for more such events to make school life much more meaningful and joyful.

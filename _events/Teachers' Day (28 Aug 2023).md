Although it is a simple word, "gratitude" has a profound meaning. Expressing gratitude may seem insignificant, but it can make a person's day. I fully understand the meaning of "gratitude" now that the Student Council has organised this year's Teachers' Day Celebrations. The Student Council wanted the students to acknowledge the impact our teachers and staff have had on us and appreciate their "heart and hard work". Many students might not be aware of it, but our teachers impart valuable morals and values to us and inspire us to be better versions of ourselves every day. Thus, the Student Council Executive Committee decided that "Hollywood" would be this year's theme for the Celebrations, as our teachers are stars in their own right. Being in charge of this year's Celebrations was not easy as it involved everything from coming up with the programmes, casting students for performances, to staging rehearsals. However, doing this to express our gratitude to our teachers was what kept us going despite the strain we felt. After all, they themselves have gone through a demanding and stressful year, and they deserved a good celebration. 

In addition, the staff were also treated to a Teachers' Day celebration lunch at Orchard Hotel on 31 August 2023, Thursday. This was organised by the school's Staff Well-Being Committee. The staff were told to dress up to the theme of 'Red Carpet'. Many of our staff rose to the occasion and commemorated this very special occasion. 

In the end, we are glad that the Student Council's and the Staff Well-Being Committee's efforts paid off, as the event was an enjoyable and memorable one for both the teachers and students.

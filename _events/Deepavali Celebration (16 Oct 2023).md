The Deepavali Celebration was kickstarted and brightened up by some of the East Spring girls with oil lamps that are significant to the festival of lights. The girls gracefully and elegantly lit up the stage with the oil lamps and lights. There was a myriad of performances by both teachers and students. From Mr Mazli, Mdm Oh and Yazhini's (2D) singing to the Indian girls and Chinese girls' dance performances, students were cheering and applauding enthusiastically for all performances. Students were thrilled when the Mother Tongue teachers put up a finale dance performance to end off the concert segment. Each of the performances had a meaningful connection to Indian culture and the significance of the Deepavali festival. The celebrations were also a great opportunity for students and teachers to showcase their talents.Â .

Following the concert in the hall, it was a seamless transition to the second segment in the classrooms, where students learnt more about the significance of Deepavali. Students learnt about what Deepavali is, how it is celebrated, what is eaten during the festival, as well as the similarities between other festivities celebrated in Singapore. The Kahoot Quiz truly excited the student population the most, as 3 students from each class stood a chance to grab the Deepavali goodie bags. All in all, the first-ever Deepavali celebration in the school was indubitably one to remember for everyone!
